## 3. Key Features

- **Comprehensive API Set:**  
  Access functions for submitting governance proposals, querying network status, executing transactions, and more.
  
- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  While the primary SDK is written in TypeScript, the design is modular to allow for easy integration with Python, Rust, or other languages.
  
- **Asynchronous Operations:**  
  Built with asynchronous programming paradigms to ensure non-blocking interactions with the network.
  
- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Detailed error messages and logging mechanisms to facilitate debugging and ensure resilience.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  Modular design allows for the addition of new APIs and support for emerging features without disrupting existing functionality.
  
- **Developer-Friendly Documentation:**  
  Comprehensive guides, code samples, and tutorials make it easy to get started and integrate with the Nodara ecosystem.

## 4. Architecture and Design

The SDK is structured to offer a clear separation of concerns:
- **Core Module:**  
  Provides basic network connection functions, request/response handling, and error management.
  
- **Governance Module:**  
  Exposes APIs for submitting proposals, voting, and executing decisions on-chain.
  
- **Utility Functions:**  
  Helper functions for data conversion, serialization, and formatting to ensure smooth interaction with the blockchain.
  
- **Extensibility Layer:**  
  An architecture that allows additional modules (e.g., identity management, marketplace operations) to be integrated seamlessly.

## 5. Available Modules and APIs

- **Base API:**  
  - `sendRpcRequest(method: string, params: any[]): Promise<any>`: Sends a generic RPC request to the Nodara network.
  - `getNetworkStatus(): Promise<any>`: Retrieves current network status and performance metrics.
  
- **Governance API:**  
  - `submitProposal(description: string, parameter: string, value: string): Promise<any>`: Submits a new governance proposal.
  - `voteProposal(proposalId: string, vote: boolean): Promise<any>`: Casts a vote on an existing proposal.
  - `executeProposal(proposalId: string): Promise<any>`: Executes an approved proposal.
  
- **Additional Modules:**  
  Further APIs can be extended for identity, marketplace, and other functionalities as the ecosystem grows.
