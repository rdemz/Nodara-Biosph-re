# Nodara BIOSPHÈRE QUANTIC Runtime - Legendary Edition

This folder contains the global runtime implementation for Nodara BIOSPHÈRE QUANTIC. The runtime orchestrates the integration of all individual modules (pallets) into a cohesive blockchain network. It is built using Substrate and leverages the `construct_runtime!` macro to combine each module seamlessly.

## Key Components

- **Integration of Pallets:**  
  All core modules (e.g., nodara_biosphere, nodara_growth_model, nodara_stability_guard, etc.) are integrated here.

- **Performance and Security:**  
  The runtime includes performance benchmarks, secure configuration settings, and audit logging to ensure that every state transition is robust and verifiable.

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  Comprehensive integration tests are performed within the runtime environment to validate the interactions between modules.

## Structure

- `src/lib.rs`: Contains the main code for the runtime, including the integration of all pallets.
- Additional configuration files and scripts (if necessary) for environment setup and deployment.

Follow the instructions below to build and test the runtime:
1. Ensure all individual pallets have been finalized and tested.
2. Run `cargo build --release` in the runtime folder to compile the runtime.
3. Execute integration tests with `cargo test --all` to validate the runtime functionality.
